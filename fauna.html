                <h2>Wildlife</h2>
                <p><strong> Wildlife consisting of animals, birds, insects, etc. living in the forest is a national resource, which not only helps in maintaining the ecological balance but is also beneficial for various economic activities that generate revenue from tourism.<br>The rich flora and fauna also play a major role in maintaining the ecological balance of a region.<br>There was a time when human needs were minimal and there was bare interference in the wildlife. There is no denying the fact that due to urbanization, pollution, and human interventions wildlife is rapidly disappearing from the planet.<br>Today the biodiversity of the world is threatened due to the extinction of species.<br> There are thirty-five hotspots around the world, which supports 43% of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians as endemic.<br><br>The IUCN has compiled a list of species and has classified the different species under extinct, critically endangered, less endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, and least concerned.<br><br><I>This list is called the Red Data Book</I>.<br><br> According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of birds, animals, marine and freshwater creatures has dropped by almost one-third of its earlier population.<br>Causes for Decline or Threat to WildlifeOne of the major reasons for the constant decline of wildlife is humans ever-increasing demands and greed that have led to deforestation and habitat destruction. <br>For development and urbanization, man has chopped down trees to build dams, highways, and towns and this has forced the animals to retreat further and further into the receding forests.Rapid industrialization and urbanization due to the fast growth in population in recent decades have taken a heavy toll on wildlife. <br>Global warming and extensive environmental pollution have largely threatened wildlife as they lead to habitat destruction and rising temperature.</strong>

                              <p class="card-text">Donkeys have been domesticated since 4,000 BCE. These hard-working creatures are used as draught or pack animals in developing countries of the Global South. In developed countries, donkeys are sometimes kept as pets. Domesticated donkeys are sometimes also used as guard animals for cows, goats and sheep against coyotes, although, the coyote is the only natural enemy to donkeys as well.<br>Living in desert plains of African countries, wild donkeys can survive on very little food and water for long periods of time. Donkeys are also prevalent in Asia, notably China and Pakistan, and Mexico.</p>

                                  <p class="card-text">The red fox originated from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America shortly after the Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes, the red fox represents a more progressive form in the direction of carnivory. Apart from its large size, the red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes and the small, basal southern grey desert foxes of Asia and North Africa.
                                    Red foxes are usually together in pairs or small groups consisting of families, such as a mated pair and their young, or a male with several females having kinship ties.</p>
